# My Approach to Learning

I am learning C# and .NET through a combination of self-led study and project-based learning. My process includes using AI assistance and making the most of available resources. At the start, I defined my S.M.A.R.T. goals and asked GPT to help create a structured curriculum, including documentation and video resources for reference. I follow this schedule to ensure I learn just enough to meet my goal of being prepared for an upcoming internship where I would be using this technology.

For every lesson, I make sure to apply what I have learned. This could be through a mini project or by reflecting on and explaining new concepts in my own words. This approach helps reinforce my understanding and track my progress. If I don't code or write it myself, then I didn't learn anything.

Additionally, I maintain a dedicated chat with GPT, where I ask it to act as a senior C# developer and mentor. In this chat, GPT is prohibited from giving me direct code answers. Instead, it provides guidance, thought processes, and clear explanations. If code is necessary, only small snippets are given to prove a point or serve as an example. I think this method is effective as it helps me build independent problem-solving skills and exercises my ability to piece things to together to make an informed conclusion.
